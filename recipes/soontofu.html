        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Soontofu is a Korean comfort food dish with a spicy broth that is complemented by tofu, meat and other vegetables. It is typically served on a black stone pot and served with a side of rice. Many people enjoy having a separate dish of galbi to add to the experience.</p>
            <p>I personally enjoy soontofu and it is one of my favorite dishes to eat especially around Orange County.</p>
